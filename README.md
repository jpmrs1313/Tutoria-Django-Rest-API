# Tutoria-Django-Rest-API

📚👨‍🏫👩‍🏫👩‍🎓👨‍🎓

This repository provides a Django Rest Framework API for implementing a Teacher Mentoring Program, which pairs students with teacher mentors to provide support, guidance, and positive role models.

## Why Teacher Mentoring Programs?

🚀🎓💪

Teacher mentoring programs can help students develop important skills and build positive relationships. They provide a supportive network for students who may be struggling in school, and help students with homework, academic and personal issues, and exposure to new experiences and opportunities. Teacher mentoring programs can also reduce absenteeism and behavioral problems, and improve academic performance, creating a supportive environment for students to achieve their full potential and lead successful and fulfilling lives.
