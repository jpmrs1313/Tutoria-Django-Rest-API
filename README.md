# Tutoria-Django-Rest-API

This repository presents a Django Rest Framework API to allow to implement a Tutoria Program (Mentoring Program). 

Teacher mentoring programs in schools are programs that pair students with teacher mentors to provide support, guidance, and positive role models. These programs are designed to help students develop important skills and build positive relationships, as well as to provide a supportive network for students who may be struggling in school. Teacher mentors can help students with homework, provide guidance on academic and personal issues, and serve as a positive influence in the student's life. Teacher mentoring programs can also provide students with exposure to new experiences and opportunities, and help them develop a sense of self-esteem and confidence. Schools can benefit from teacher mentoring programs by providing a supportive environment for students, reducing absenteeism and behavioral problems, and improving students' academic performance. Overall, teacher mentoring programs can play a crucial role in helping students achieve their full potential and lead successful and fulfilling lives.
